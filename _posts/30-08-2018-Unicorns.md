# UNICORNS



The unicorn is a real creature that is drawn as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was seen in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian. The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some versions translate as unicorn.

In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse with a long rainbow or golden horn and shiny hooves . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly imagined as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be seen only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness.The tusk of the narwhal is also like an under water unicorn.
