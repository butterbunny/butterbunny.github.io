# This is a short story of what happened to me and my best friend 2 years ago
### One sunny day when unicors where flying through the sky(or maybe not...),me and my friend had this "fantastic idea" to go around a castle. It was half an hour away from our house and we decided to go at 6pm...(more or less(maybe(I don´t remember))).Well the point is that we went and the following set of events happened:We found our current secret spot (It´s very secret(VERY)).

We walked along this thin wall until we saw this camping area. It was really creepy and after some time we saw this man...He was black (not racist just describing someone) and he looked like he was homeless(no offence). We were scared so we run back looking for the exit but we couldn´t find it. At this point we were really panicked and we noticed he was following us. He had probably heard us and was probably trying to help but we were too scared to notice. After some time we eventualy found it and we were very relieved.

We were still in shock so we jumped down (something I will never be able to do now) and slipped all the way down the mountain. We were half way down when we heard the man behind us saying congrats for making it down. We were so confused....At the bottom we were able to finally  breath and talk about what had occured
