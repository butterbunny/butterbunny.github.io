#Open your eyes

#Now I am 24 and It is true that I have killed and been killed and yet I hope by this statement that I am not a murderer nor an immortal. I lived heaven back then in grades five and six. Until one day my guardian angel couldn’t protect me anymore. I saw it all. Now I must stop him who is doing this to me. To protect him and her. They who protected me.
I woke up and the first colour that I saw was black. I squinted and then I noticed two red eyes staring back at me. I saw anger and sadness through its dark black curtains. Back then I didn’t understand. All I knew was that I had to help him or her. I slowly approached the two glaring eyes. Every footstep I took echoed. As I got closer, I distinguished a little boy wearing a yellow jacket and handmade mittens. He was holding a metal object, but I couldn’t see what it was. The closer I got, the more obvious some red stains on the jacket became. All I could hear was a never-ending sound of screaming kids, I didn´t like it. 
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a large and bright flash blinded me. The world around me was faing in and out. I took me a few seconds to get used to the dark again, but when I looked down I saw the little boys body covered in red, the metal object stabbed in his heart, his corpse lay motionless on the cold ground. As I knelt beside him, I smelled the smell of rotten flesh. I took a closer look and found his school pass. It was covered in blood. On it I read “Kai-Jun”. My eyes started crying and I couldn’t stop some unintentional sobs. 
He was, he was my dead brother. 
He had killed himself 3 years ago. He was in deep depression. He was on the roof top. With me. His last words where “promise me you will look after mommy and daddy for me”. Then he just flung himself off the edge. I have been trying to keep that promise but it is not easy. My mom is a very secretive person and if she is down she will just hide it all inside. As for my dad…. He never seemed to have any problems.
